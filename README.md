📌 Overview
This project implements a real-time Crowd Detection and Tracking System using YOLOv8 for person detection and SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking) algorithm for multi-object tracking. The system identifies individuals in crowded scenes, assigns unique IDs, tracks movement paths, and displays real-time crowd count per frame.
Developed as a major project for B.Tech Computer Science Engineering (CDAC DASSD), this solution demonstrates the practical application of computer vision in crowd monitoring and surveillance systems
